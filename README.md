#inFormative Teacher

A classroom proficiency tracking system for teachers, specialists, and coaches.

##About the Project

inFormative Teacher is a tool designed to simplify tracking soft dataâ€”information about student progress that isn't captured in formal gradebooks or assessments. Originally developed for my sister, a fourth-grade teacher, this project is inspired by my own experiences as a former educator from a family of teachers. My hope is to expand inFormative Teacher into a resource that benefits teachers, therapists, and coaches alike.

The project began as a Tech Elevator capstone with a backend built in Java and Spring Boot, integrated with a PostgreSQL database, and a frontend developed using Vue.js. It has since grown into a flexible, user-friendly platform.

##Features

-Track Progress: Quickly log artifacts tied to specific indicators, assigning numerical scores to monitor growth.
-Pre-Built & Custom Indicators: Use pre-built subjects for core curriculum or customize diagnostic criteria to suit your needs.
-Data Visualization: Generate dynamic data maps to visualize individual or group progress.
-User-Centric Design: Tailored for ease of use by classroom teachers, specialists, and coaches.
